    # shared agent rules

    This is the only repository agent instruction file. Read [the workspace entrypoint](../AGENTS.md),
    the [canonical protocol](../platform/docs/standards/AI_AGENT_DEVELOPMENT_PROTOCOL.md),
    the enterprise brain, applicable accepted ADRs and the owning platform requirements before
    material work. Follow authority precedence; this file narrows implementation behavior only.
    If a required authority is missing, stop before mutation.

    **Layer:** L1 shared/config; L2 framework. **Accountable platform:** PLT-OPS. **Scope:** Cross-platform primitives and runtime framework.
    Resolve actual dependencies, packages and scripts from current manifests and the platform catalog.
    Preserve unrelated changes. Define numbered acceptance criteria and a knowledge delta before editing.
    For coordinated changes, publish the change contract, validate upstream first, and hand off
    to downstream consumers with exact evidence.

    ## Repository rules

    - Shared and config packages must not import framework or higher layers; framework may consume lower-layer published packages.
- Keep utilities domain-neutral, typed and deterministic. Use exact decimal math for monetary helpers.
- Validate package exports and every affected consumer before changing public behavior.

    ## Verification

    Run applicable commands from this repository, plus risk-specific contract, security, data,
    accessibility, integration, migration or release gates required by the canonical protocol:
    pnpm typecheck; pnpm lint; pnpm test; pnpm build; node ../platform/workspace/scripts/check-layer.mjs

    A command's presence here is not proof that it ran. Report exact results, failures and NOT RUN
    reasons; review the diff; then follow the canonical status and source-control procedure.
